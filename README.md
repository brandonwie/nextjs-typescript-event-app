# NEXT EVENTS

Social Events App using dummy data

## File-based Routing

A practice using Next and TypeScript

## Adopting Material UI into Next

To use Next with Material UI, there has been continuous mismatch of className props due to SSR features of Next.
<br />
`pages/_document.tsx` and settings of `_app.tsx` will solve the issue by

1. Remove SSR styles before rendering and then apply local styles
2. MUI styles will be rendered after the app and page styles are applied.
